          <p className="text-neutral-600 mb-3">
            Open D2C is a product discovery platform that indexes publicly available product data from
            Indian D2C brand websites — including product titles, images, descriptions, and prices sourced
            from sitemaps and structured data. We operate similarly to a search engine: we do not sell products,
            hold inventory, or process transactions.
          </p>
          <p className="text-neutral-600">
            Some brands on Open D2C were added by us proactively because their products are publicly
            available online. If your brand was listed without your explicit consent and you would like
            it removed, this page explains how to request that.

          <p className="text-neutral-600 mb-3">
            If you are a brand owner and do not wish your products to appear on Open D2C, you can

          <p className="text-neutral-600 mb-3">
            If you believe that content displayed on Open D2C infringes your copyright, you may submit
            a formal DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) takedown notice. While Open D2C operates
            under Indian law, we respect DMCA takedown requests as a baseline standard for intellectual
            property protection globally.
          </p>
          <p className="text-neutral-600 mb-3">
            A valid DMCA notice must include:
